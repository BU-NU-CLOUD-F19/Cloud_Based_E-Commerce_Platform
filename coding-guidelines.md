# Coding Guidelines

Note: _This coding guidelines are for general coding and doesn't focus on any particular programming language._

```json
1. Follow KISS principle. The code should be as simple as possible.
2. DRY. You should not repeat yourself. If you find repeating yourself, try to seperate that into different functionality.
3. The code should be as modular as possible.
4. The code should be well documented.
  - The file header should contain a brief description of what the file is trying to achieve.
  - The method should have multiline comments before its implementation.
  - Trailing single line comments for complex logic
5. Don't over-engineer.
6. Avoid premature optimization of the code.
7. Follow naming conventions.
  - camelCase for variable names
  - kebab-case for file names
  - snake_case in all-caps for global constants
  - The method names should be meaningful and give a hint of what the method is about.
8. The code should be properly indented.
9. Write clean code rather than clever code.
