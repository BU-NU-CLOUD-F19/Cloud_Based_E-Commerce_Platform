# Test UI
A very basic UI that shows the base cart & checkout functionality, as well as inventory management product listings.
You need to have all of the containers running for this to work.
It's enough to open the HTML file in your browser, but you can also start your favorite web server (Python `http.server`, Node `http-server`, stick it in Apache/NGINX, whatever you like).

This code was written in two hours under the pressure of finishing an assignment, please don't judge too harshly.
